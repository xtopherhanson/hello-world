# hello-world
Idk, it's the tutorial or something

My name is Christopher. I am a mathematician, computer scientist, wanna-be author, and Jedi Knight.
I enjoy long walks on the beach, or the street, or Hoth, or back and forth in my dorm.
I surround myself with other Jedis, Christian friends, intillects, and strangers.
Bring me pizza.
